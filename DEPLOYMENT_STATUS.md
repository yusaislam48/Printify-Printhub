### Current Authentication

**Working Booth Manager Credentials:**
- Email: `booth1@printify.com`
- Password: `Yu2521191`
- Manager: Yusa
- Booth: Booth 1
- Location: DMK5002

### Deployment History

**v18 (Current)** - ‚úÖ SUCCESSFUL
- Fixed Procfile to remove unnecessary `cd server` command
- Booth manager routes now properly loaded and mounted
- Authentication working with JWT tokens
- All endpoints responding correctly

**v17** - ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial Success
- Added debug logs to troubleshoot route mounting
- Identified Procfile issue causing server startup problems

**v16** - ‚ùå Failed
- Booth manager files deployed but routes not accessible
- Server startup issues due to incorrect Procfile

### Technical Implementation

**Server Side:**
- ‚úÖ Booth manager routes deployed and mounted at `/api/booth-managers`
- ‚úÖ Controller functions properly exported and working
- ‚úÖ Model schema correctly defined in MongoDB
- ‚úÖ JWT middleware functioning correctly
- ‚úÖ Database connection stable

**Client Side (PrintHub App):**
- ‚úÖ Login interface with Material Design
- ‚úÖ Secure IPC communication between main and renderer processes
- ‚úÖ Error handling with user-friendly messages
- ‚úÖ Session management and automatic logout
- ‚úÖ Print job management interface

### API Endpoints Working

‚úÖ `POST /api/booth-managers/login` - Authentication  
‚úÖ `GET /api/print/public/jobs/student/:studentId` - Job search  
‚úÖ `POST /api/print/public/jobs/:jobId/complete` - Mark completed  
‚úÖ `POST /api/print/public/jobs/:jobId/print-now` - Direct printing  
‚úÖ `GET /api/print/public/view/:jobId` - PDF viewing  

### Next Steps

**Immediate:**
- ‚úÖ System is ready for production use
- ‚úÖ No further deployment needed
- ‚úÖ All features operational

**Future Enhancements:**
- Create additional booth manager accounts as needed
- Monitor system performance and logs
- Add more booth locations if required

### Verification

Run the verification script to confirm everything is working:
```bash
cd server
node verify-booth-manager.js
```

Expected output: ‚úÖ All systems operational
